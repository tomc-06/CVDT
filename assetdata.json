      "description": "In Gas Transmission, our journey to net zero focuses primarily on the ways that hydrogen could be used to replace natural gas, and is one of the most important economic, technical, and social challenges faced by the business. The FutureGrid project is the first of many steps towards a full-scale conversion of the existing National Transmission System (NTS) to transport hydrogen. The Phase 1 FutureGrid test facility is constructed largely from decommissioned assets that will be used to carry out a wide range of hydrogen tests in an offline environment to demonstrate the National Transmission System's ability to transport hydrogen safely and reliably.",
